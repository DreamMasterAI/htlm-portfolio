<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Dadesky Sagaille, and Iâ€™m excited to share a bit about my journey with you. I come from Miami, Florida, a place that taught me the importance of resilience, hard work, and always striving for better. My career path has been a journey across multiple fields, each one helping me learn, grow, and gain valuable experiences along the way.</p>

<p>My professional journey began in the restaurant industry, where I learned the importance of teamwork, customer service, and adaptability. I started in dishwashing and worked my way up to become a bartender, where I honed my people skills, time management, and multitasking abilities. These skills became the foundation for the next steps in my career.</p>

<p>From bartending, I transitioned into sales, which allowed me to apply my interpersonal skills in a new way. In sales, I developed a strong understanding of communication and negotiation, and I thrived on setting and achieving challenging goals. However, my passion for technology continued to grow, and I knew I wanted to take my career in a new direction.</p>

<p>Now, I am dedicated to learning and advancing in the world of computers and technology. From working with new software to coding and problem-solving, I am continuously motivated by the endless possibilities in this field. I'm currently focused on building my skills and gaining knowledge to excel in computer-based work. Every step of my journey has been challenging yet rewarding, and I am driven to keep pushing forward and learning as much as I can.</p>
